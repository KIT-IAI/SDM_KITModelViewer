# CityGML roof analysis (RoofKIT project)

RoofKIT, developed as part of the ‘Solar Decathlon Europe 21/22’, is an energy concept for CO₂-neutral extensions on existing urban flat roofs with roof-integrated PVT collectors, heat pumps, electricity and heat storage systems and an intelligent energy management system. The aim is to achieve a high degree of solar self-generation, grid-friendliness and the creation of living space. As such extensions have an impact on the electricity grid, their effect is being investigated experimentally under real conditions in the KIT Energy Laboratory's real laboratory - including user behaviour and grid connection - in order to develop solutions for energy management at building and grid level.
 
As not every building is suitable for an extension, building models are analysed in the neutral CityGML standard to identify suitable existing buildings. The aim is to quantify residential buildings with flat roofs and sufficient roof area for a RoofKIT extension. The Python script developed for this purpose identifies precisely these residential buildings with flat roofs and writes their gml:id, building height and roof area to a .csv file for further processing.
